# liri-node-app
What the project does.
    This project creates an app that allows the users to get information on the song, concert, movies, and read the content of random.txt file. The project should include the following API:
        - Spotify for songs
        - Band in Town for concerts
        - OMDB for movies.

     Spotify and OMDB API are included in this project but the Band in town is not completed due to the time constrain for this project. It will be completed in the near future. The users can use this project as a guideline for their own app.

This project will be useful for the users that try to learn Node.js and want to include some useful API in the market. The project will be maintain by Sompon Boontho.
